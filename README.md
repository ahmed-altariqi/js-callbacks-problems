## Getting started

To run the tests you first need to install the dependencies (using pnpm, npm or yarn), then replace everything inside /my-solutions with your own solutions or create a new folder with your own solutions and make sure to update the test files with the new path.

Install dependencies:

```shell
 $ pnpm i
```

Run tests:

```shell
 $ pnpm test
```
